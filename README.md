## Prompts

### Content Model Prompt

> "I want to create a website that primarily draws people in to check the time but the background of the time is a beautiful photo that can also be purchased if the user wants so the website is really a photographer's photo marketplace but disguised as a site that tells the time. I want there to be a small transparent button for people to hover their curser over to get info on the art like artist, description of art, and price and then a link to a for sale page on that art. and then also a small button on the page for artists to learn about how to submit their own art for sale and for use as a background image for the site. Can this be done?"
